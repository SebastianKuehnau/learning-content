This article shows how to migrate from a Vaadin 7 application to the new Vaadin platform through an example application. The application displays a list of persons with their names, phone numbers, and email addresses in a grid and a corresponding form the data can be changed.

The code for this example is available on GitHub, and the subsequent steps can be done in parallel.

== 1. Update your pom XML

In the beginning, we need to make some minimal changes in the pom.xml to get the new framework dependencies, remove unnecessary plugins and adjust the configuration. An important step is updating the version number to the latest release of the Vaadin platform and adding vaadin-core as a dependency to your project. The latest version of the Vaadin platform, as well as the current LTS version, can be found on vaadin.com. Afterward, we need to remove deprecated entities like:

* vaadin-server, vaadin-push, vaadin-client-compiled, vaadin-themes,
* plugins (maven-clean, vaadin-maven, maven-war) and
* the maven-profile for vaadin-prerelease.

Since there were changes in the Vaadin maven plugin, it is necessary to add the tag `*failOnMissingWebXml*` as a property to the header and set its value to `*false*`. As the name suggests, this configuration makes sure your application is starting without a web.xml file and is implicitly set in the maven war plugin. This configuration won’t be necessary if we start the application with spring-boot.

Optional we could also update the version number for _eclipse-jetty-plugin_ and the _servlet-api_.

== 2. Change the existing code and start using Vaadin platform components

=== a. UI-class is not mandatory anymore
In the next step, we go into the code. The UI class is not necessary for Vaadin platform applications anymore and can be removed from your project. This UI class was instantiated for each browser tab and used to initialize the first call of the application, managing the navigator and optional servlet configuration.

In Vaadin platform applications most of the configurations need to be done via Servlet Init Listeners (either web servlet or vaadin servlet listeners). In an application with a Spring Context, you could use application property files to configure your application.

You can find information about this topic here:

https://vaadin.com/docs/v10/flow/advanced/tutorial-flow-runtime-configuration.html

https://vaadin.com/docs/v10/flow/migration/3-general-differences.html

=== b. Navigation and Routing
In Vaadin platform the distinction between a component and a view has become obsolete so you could use any component in your application as an entry point. To make them available via an URL fragment, you annotate the component you want to navigate to with `*@Route*` and add the URL fragment in brackets behind of the annotation. If the value for Route is empty, this class becomes your default entry point and is displayed after calling your application server. Also, the navigator-concept has become obsolete as the views and components are registered automatically.

.`*Vaadin 7*`
[source,java]
----
public class ListView extends HorizontalLayout implements View {
    …
}
----

.`*Vaadin platform*`
[source,java]
----
@HtmlImport("styles/shared-styles.html")
@Route("")
public class ListView extends HorizontalLayout {
    …
}
----

The class names in the code snippets were taken from the previous Vaadin 7 application to show the same components in the new Vaadin platform context.

In Vaadin flow, several interfaces are provided to implement that execute methods executed after entering or before leaving the view, to set components into a context of the main layout or manage given parameter in the URL. A detailed description and many more features can be found here:
https://vaadin.com/docs/v10/flow/routing/tutorial-routing-annotation.html

=== c. Swap the imports of the components
The previous *imports* from Vaadin 7 (`*com.vaadin.ui.**`) aren’t available anymore and can be deleted. Right now you need to replace the deprecated Vaadin 7 components with the new Vaadin platform components. The names of the components haven’t changed that much in Vaadin platform, so in most cases, you can easily replace the old imports with the new ones.

.`*Vaadin 7*`
[source,java]
----
import com.vaadin.ui.Grid;
----

.`*Vaadin platform*`
[source,java]
----
import com.vaadin.flow.component.grid.Grid;
----
=== d. Adjust your code to the new API
Vaadin introduced small changes to the Component API which need to be applied when migrating from Vaadin 7 to Vaadin platform. For example, adding components to a layout isn’t done by addComponent(s) anymore instead you would use the method `*add(component, ...)*` and pass the components as a parameter.

.`*Vaadin 7*`
[source,java]
----
addComponents(personGrid, personForm);
----

.`*Vaadin platform*`
[source,java]
----
add(personGrid, personForm);
----

==== e. Use generics to type components
Since Vaadin 8 you can use generics to bind beans directly to several components and make their usage typesafe. This makes the interaction with components more efficient (e.g., less casting in listeners) and less error-prone (e.g., property names are not mandatory).

.`*Vaadin 7*`
[source,java]
----
Grid personGrid = new Grid();
personGrid.addColumn("name")...
personGrid.addSelectionListener(event -> {
    Person person = (Person) event.getSelected() ...
});
----

.`*Vaadin platform*`
[source,java]
----
Grid<Person> personGrid = new Grid<>(Person.class)
personGrid.addColumn(Person::getName)...
personGrid.addSelectionListener(selectionEvent -> {
    Person person = selectionEvent.getFirstSelectedItem().get();
    ...
});
----

=== f. Refactor Data-Binding according to new DataModel API
The data modeling has been mostly retained from Vaadin 8, and due to the reason the API has completely changed compared to Vaadin 7 let’s make short recap how data are bound to the UI in Vaadin 7 in the first instance.

In Vaadin 7 data sources are not directly bound to UI-components to avoid extra implementation work (data communication, etc.) and any other conflicts (data type mismatch). To decouple the data source and component, we have a _property_ between the bean attribute and the field on the UI. This property has a type and contains a value. All changes from the UI are buffered in the property and can be read or set to the backend via a simple Java API.
[.text-center]
*Bean-Attribute ←→ Property ←→ Field*

To convert values between the component and the bean and validate the user input according to the requested format, you need to attach Converters and Validators directly to the field. The field value is available through a property, and value changes are propagated via several listeners.

A list of properties can be encapsulated into an item, and a list of items are bound to a container, which can be used in a Grid, Combobox, etc. With item, you can bind a bean to a FieldGroup on a form and a collection of beans to list many items in a component (like a grid).
[.text-center]
*List of beans ←→ Container ←→ Item ←→ Properties ←→ UI Component*

More information about properties and data provider can be found here:
https://vaadin.com/docs/v7/framework/datamodel/datamodel-properties.html
and here
https://vaadin.com/docs/v7/framework/datamodel/datamodel-container.html.

The Databinding API was simplified in Vaadin 8 and the same can also be used in Vaadin platform. The concept of properties, containers, and FieldGroups have been removed, and bean attributes can directly bind to the UI component via a new element called binder. Since Vaadin 8, converters and validators are attached to the binder and not the fields anymore.

Here are the necessary steps to change a simple read and update view from the Vaadin 7 binding APIs to those of Vaadin platform:

[cols="2*", options="header,footer"]
|=======================
^|Vaadin 7
^|Vaadin 8 / Vaadin platform
2+|`@PropertyId("email")` {nbsp} +
`private final TextField emailField = new TextField("Email");`
|`FieldGroup binder =` {nbsp} +
  {nbsp} `new FieldGroup();`
|`Binder<Person> binder =` {nbsp} + 
  {nbsp} `new Binder<>(Person.class);`
|`binder.bind(emailField, "email");`
.4+|`binder.forField(emailField)` {nbsp} +
  {nbsp} `.withNullRepresentation(“”)` {nbsp} +
  {nbsp} `.withValidator(...)` {nbsp} +
  {nbsp} `.withConverter(...)` {nbsp} +
  {nbsp} `.asRequired(...)` {nbsp} +
  {nbsp} `.bind(Person::getEmail, Person::setEmail);`
|`emailField.addValidator(...);`
|`emailField.setConverter(...);`
|`emailField.setRequired(true);`
|`emailField.setImmediate(true);`|`binder.setBean(item);`
|`binder.bindMemberFields(formLayout);`|`binder.bindInstanceFields(formLayout);`
|`binder.setBuffered(true);`|_Beans are buffered in item-object implicitly when calling the readBean method._
|`binder.setItemDataSource(item);`|`binder.readBean(item);`
|`binder.commit();`|`binder.writeBean(currentPerson);`
|`binder.clear();`|`binder.readBean(new Person());`
|=======================

In Vaadin platform, you use a `DataProvider` for binding a list of beans to the UI component. In the example, the default DataProvider of the grid component is used, which is an in-memory DataProvider.

[options="header,footer"]
|=======================
|Vaadin 7|Vaadin platform
|`Grid personGrid = new Grid();`
|`Grid<Person> personGrid =` {nbsp} + 
{nbsp} `new Grid<>(Person.class);`
|`BeanItemContainer<Person> personContainer =` {nbsp} + 
{nbsp} `new BeanItemContainer<>(Person.class);`

`personContainer.addAll(personService.getPersonList());`

`personGrid.setContainerDataSource(personContainer);`
|`personGrid.setItems(` {nbsp} + 
{nbsp} `personService.getPersonList());`
||`personGrid.getDataProvider()` {nbsp} + 
{nbsp} `.refreshItem(person) ;`
|`personGrid.addSelectionListener(...);`
`personGrid.addItemClickListener(...);`|`personGrid.addSelectionListener(...);`
|=======================

This article shows you the first practical steps to migrate your vaadin application from version 7 to Vaadin platform. Other topics you need to take into consideration when switching to the new Vaadin platform are theming, API of components, usage of MPR (Multi-Platform Runtime) and integration of web components.

More information about migrations with Vaadin can be found in the documentation (https://vaadin.com/docs/v10/flow/migration/1-migrating-v8-v10.html).
